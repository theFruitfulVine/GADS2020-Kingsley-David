# LAB 05: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

## By Kingsley David

## Overview

In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	- Initialize App Engine.

	- Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

	- Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

	- Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

## Steps

1. Initialise App Engine

	a) Initialise your App Engine app with your project and choose its region.

		gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

		Enter a preferred region when prompted

	b) Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello world directory.

		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

	c) Navigate to the source directory.

		cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

2. Run Hello World application locally

	a) Download and update the packages list by running the command below

		sudo apt-get update

	b) Set up an environment variable in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package applications from the system.

		sudo apt-get install virtualenv

	c) Activate the virtual environment

		virtualenv -p python3 venv

	d) Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies

		pip install -r requirements.txt

	e) Run the application

		python main.py

	f) Enter below URL in a new browser tab to preview your application

		http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

	g) End the test by executing the below command in Cloud Shell

		Ctrl+C


3. Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

	a) Navigate to the source directory

		cd ~python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

	b) Deploy your Hello World application

		gcloud app deploy

		Press "Y" and then Enter if prompted to comtinue

	c) Launch your new browser tab to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

		gcloud app browse

	d) Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window


4. Disable the application

	- Navigate to App Engine > Settings from the GCP Console

	- Click Disable Application

	- Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.


Congratulations.
